# 🏆 Baseline Tooling Hackathon Submission

## Project: Baseline Buddy
**AI-powered developer companion that integrates Baseline data to accelerate modern web feature adoption**

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

New web developers face a critical challenge: **they don't know which modern web features are safe to use in production**. This uncertainty creates a productivity tax where developers either:
- Stick to outdated practices (missing out on modern capabilities)
- Use cutting-edge features that break in production  
- Spend hours researching compatibility across multiple sources

## 💡 Solution Overview

Baseline Buddy is a comprehensive developer tooling suite that integrates [Baseline](https://web.dev/baseline/) compatibility data directly into development workflows through:

### 🛠️ CLI Tool
- **Project scaffolding** with Baseline-optimized templates
- **Real-time compatibility analysis** of existing projects
- **Feature search** across 519+ web features
- **HTML/JSON report generation** for teams
- **Polyfill injection** for legacy browser support

### ⚡ VS Code Extension  
- **Real-time hover tooltips** showing Baseline status
- **Inline compatibility warnings** as you type
- **Smart feature detection** for CSS and JavaScript
- **Educational guidance** with recommendations

### 📊 Web Dashboard
- **Visual compatibility reports** for projects
- **Interactive feature search** and exploration
- **Team collaboration** tools
- **Progress tracking** toward modern standards

### 3. Educational Component
Beyond just showing compatibility data, it provides:
- Contextual recommendations
- Learning guidance for modern features
- Safe adoption pathways

### 4. Complete Workflow Coverage
From project creation to deployment:
```bash
baseline-buddy init my-project    # Safe scaffolding
baseline-buddy check             # Compatibility analysis  
baseline-buddy deploy            # Validated deployment
```
